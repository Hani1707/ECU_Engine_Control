# ECU_Engine_Control
Developed a complete Electronic Control Unit (ECU) system for electric vehicle engine management using AUTOSAR Classic Platform. Key functionalities included torque and speed control, thermal management, current and voltage regulation, and regenerative braking. The system was designed to enhance overall engine performance, ensure safety through fault protection, maintain traction, and improve energy efficiency. Implementation based on the AUTOSAR Classic architecture enabled standardized software development, improved modularity, and ensured scalability and reusability across different vehicle platforms.
